# RTL Design Practice

This repository contains my daily RTL design practice for VLSI preparation.
All designs are written in Verilog and verified using Vivado.

## Day 1 – Basic Logic Gates
### Implemented Modules
- AND gate
- OR gate
- NOT gate

### Verification
- Single testbench to verify all three gates
- Simulation done using Vivado

### Folder Structure
- combinational/ : RTL modules
- testbenches/  : Testbench files
